# LitMan
LitMan: Literature Manager for the lit[^*] man[^**].

[^*]: As cool was in the 80s, wicked in the 90s and sick in the 00s, I believe lit is what the kids said in the 10s (at least, in the UK, and I really have no idea).
[^**]: LitMan is for any gender identity, it just seemed a fun pun (of course it isn't).
